FEATURES:
-Detect network on mint page and ask the user to change
-Mention the supported networks for Randomness https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/subscription/supported-networks . We could for these other chains use pseudo randomness, create a random number by using the current time, a users address, the block difficulty and any other random info from the last transaction that fills the lottery, it would be practically impossible for somebody to calculate and predict all of this but it isn't 100% randomness.
